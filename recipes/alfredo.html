    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Fettuccine Alfredo is a classic Italian-American pasta dish known for its rich, creamy sauce and simple
        elegance.
        Traditionally made with just butter, heavy cream, and freshly grated Parmesan cheese, the sauce coats wide
        ribbons of fettuccine in a silky, luxurious layer. As the cheese melts into the warm cream and butter mixture,
        it creates a smooth, savory sauce with a delicate balance of richness and subtle nuttiness.

        Often served as a comforting main course, Fettuccine Alfredo can be enjoyed on its own or paired with grilled
        chicken, shrimp, or vegetables for added variety. Its creamy texture and mild flavor make it a crowd-pleaser,
        perfect for both <strong>weeknight dinners</strong> and <strong>special occasions</strong>.
