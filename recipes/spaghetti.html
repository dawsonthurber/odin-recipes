    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti and meatballs is a timeless comfort dish that brings together tender, juicy meatballs and a rich,
        savory tomato sauce over a bed of perfectly cooked spaghetti. The meatballs are typically made from a mixture of
        ground beef, breadcrumbs, eggs, garlic, and herbs like parsley and oregano, then browned and simmered in the
        sauce to soak up flavor and stay moist.</p>
    <p>
        The tomato sauce, often slow-cooked with onions, garlic, crushed tomatoes, and Italian seasonings, complements
        the hearty meatballs and coats the pasta beautifully. Served with a sprinkle of Parmesan and fresh basil,
        spaghetti and meatballs is a <strong>satisfying</strong>, <strong>family-friendly</strong> meal that feels both
        <strong>homey</strong> and <strong>celebratory</strong>.
